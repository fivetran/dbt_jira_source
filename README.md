# Jira (Source) 

This package models Jira data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/jira). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/jira/#schemainformation).

> Note: This schema applies to Jira connectors set up or fully re-synced after September 10, 2020.

This package enriches your Fivetran data by doing the following:
- Adds descriptions to tables and columns that are synced using Fivetran
- Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
- Models staging tables, which will be used in our transform package

## Models
This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Jira transformation package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_jira).  The staging models:
- Remove any rows that are soft-deleted
- Name columns consistently across all packages:
    - Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
    - Timestamps are appended with `_at`
    - ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table.  For example, the `issue` table's ID column is renamed `issue_id`.
    - Foreign keys include the table that they refer to. For example, an issue's `assignee` user ID column is renamed `assignee_user_id`.

## Installation Instructions
Add the following to your `packages.yml` file:
```yml
# packages.yml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/jira_source
    version: [">=0.4.0", "<0.5.0"]
```

Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

## Configuration
By default, this package looks for your Jira data in the `jira` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Jira data is, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    jira_database: your_database_name
    jira_schema: your_schema_name 
```

### Disabling models

It's possible that your Jira connector does not sync every table that this package expects. If your syncs exclude certain tables, it is because you either don't use that functionality in Jira or actively excluded some tables from your syncs. To disable the corresponding functionality in the package, you must add the relevant variables. By default, all variables are assumed to be `true`. Add variables for only the tables you would like to disable:  

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    jira_using_sprints: false   # Disable if you do not have the sprint table, or if you do not want sprint related metrics reported
    jira_using_components: false # Disable if you do not have the component table, or if you do not want component related metrics reported
    jira_using_versions: false # Disable if you do not have the versions table, or if you do not want versions related metrics reported
    jira_using_priorities: false # disable if you are not using priorities in Jira
```

### Changing the Build Schema
By default this package will build the Jira staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_jira`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your Jira staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
    jira_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
