# Jira Source dbt Package ([Docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_jira_source/))
# 📣 What does this dbt package do?
- Cleans, tests, and prepares your Jira data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/Jira) for analysis.
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your Jira data via the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_jira_source/)
- Materializes staging tables which leverage data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/jira/#schemainformation) and is intended to work simultaneously with our [Jira modeling package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_jira)
    - Refer to our [Docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_jira_source/#!/overview/jira_source/models/?g_v=1) for more details about these materialized models. 

# 🤔 Who is the target user of this dbt package?
- You use Fivetran's [Jira connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/Jira)
- You use dbt
- You want a staging layer that cleans, tests, and prepares your Jira data for analysis
- (Optional) You want to make use of the [Jira Modeling dbt Package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_jira)
# 🎯 How do I use the dbt package?
To effectively install this package and leverage the pre-made models, you will follow the below steps:
## Step 1: Pre-Requisites
You will need to ensure you have the following before leveraging the dbt package.
- **Connector**: Have the Fivetran Jira connector syncing data into your warehouse. 
- **Database support**: This package has been tested on **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, and **Postgres**. Ensure you are using one of these supported databases.
- **dbt Version**: This dbt package requires you have a functional dbt project that utilizes a dbt version within the respective range `>=1.0.0, <2.0.0`.
## Step 2: Installing the Package
Include the following jira_source package version in your `packages.yml`
> Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/jira_source
    version: [">=0.5.0", "<0.6.0"]
```
## Step 3: Configure Your Variables
### Database and Schema Variables
By default, this package will run using your target database and the `jira` schema. If this is not where your Jira data is (perhaps your Jira schema is `jira_fivetran` and your `issue` table is named `usa_issue`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    jira_database: your_database_name
    jira_schema: your_schema_name 
```
### Disabling Components
Your Jira connector might not sync every table that this package expects. If you do not have the `SPRINT`, `COMPONENT`, or `VERSION` tables synced, add the following variable to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    jira_using_sprints: false   # Disable if you do not have the sprint table, or if you do not want sprint related metrics reported
    jira_using_components: false # Disable if you do not have the component table, or if you do not want component related metrics reported
    jira_using_versions: false # Disable if you do not have the versions table, or if you do not want versions related metrics reported
```
## (Optional) Step 4: Additional Configurations
### Change the Build Schema
By default, this package builds the GitHub staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_jira`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your GitHub staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
    jira_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```

## Step 5: Finish Setup
Your dbt project is now setup to successfully run the dbt package models! You can now execute `dbt run` and `dbt test` to have the models materialize in your warehouse and execute the data integrity tests applied within the package.

## (Optional) Step 6: Orchestrate your package models with Fivetran
Fivetran offers the ability for you to orchestrate your dbt project through the [Fivetran Transformations for dbt Core](https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/dbt) product. Refer to the linked docs for more information on how to setup your project for orchestration through Fivetran. 

# 🔍 Does this package have dependencies?
This dbt package is dependent on the following dbt packages. For more information on the below packages, refer to the [dbt hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) site.
> **If you have any of these dependent packages in your own `packages.yml` I highly recommend you remove them to ensure there are no package version conflicts.**
```yml
packages:
    - package: fivetran/fivetran_utils
      version: [">=0.3.0", "<0.4.0"]

    - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
      version: [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"]
```
